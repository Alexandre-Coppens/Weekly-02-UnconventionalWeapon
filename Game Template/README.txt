Brick Breaker

You need to break the bricks to score points to try to beat the highscore.
Each time a screen is cleared, a new one is created with more bricks.

Tips:
Hitting darker tiles create a bonus that you need to grab!
The more bricks you break without touching the paddle, the more the multiplier is!

Controls:
-Left Arrow / Right Arrow : Move paddle
-R to restart


THERE IS NO SAVE, THE HIGHSCORE IS DELETED AT THE END OF THE GAME.
